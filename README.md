# UT_Computer_Architecture
I prepared these files as my assignments during the Computer Architecture course at School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University College of Engineering, University of Tehran. I took this course during my fifth B.Sc. semester (Fall 2021).
# What do they include?
The first computer assignment (CA) is writing a SystemVerilog model of an RTL design which does a restoring division algorithm.
The second and fourth CA are the SystemVerilog codes for a single-cycle and a pipelined MIPS processor, only supporting some of the complete MIPS commands.
The third CAs is coding a processor, which we believe is inspired by ARM.
# By who?
Done by Mohammad Mahdi Moeini Manesh and me.
# What is this language? Is it Arabic?
No, it's Persian. Maybe I'll translate it into English one day.
